# CargoWise Noter

This is a small application that enables you to make local notes on different pages in CargoWise.
When running CargoWise and this notes program, you will see a little icon appear in the 
bottom of the focused CW window.

When you click the icon, it opens a small notes window you can edit:

When you close the notes window, the notes are saved to your local disk.

Each note is assosiated to the start of the name in the window title.
So a title called "Reports - Branch: ...", will be saved under "Reports".
